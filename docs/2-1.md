## FRP in NextFlow

The [`Channel`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/channel.html) class
used by NextFlow, itself based on the [DataFlow Programming
Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming) can in fact
be regarded as an implementation of a Functional Reactive Programming
library. Having said that, NextFlow allows one to mix functional and
imperative programming to the point that a developer is able to shoot
its own foot.

Furthermore, `Channel`s can not be nested which complicates certain
operations on the streams.
