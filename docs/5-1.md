## Multiple output file references

We make an implicit assumption all of the above that the output of a
pipeline step is a single file, or a single directory or a set of files
that relate to each other. What we don't cover yet is a component that
outputs both the results of analysis and a report, for instance. The
reason for this is not technical but rather that it breaks the logical
flow of a pipeline definition.

We currently output 1 *type* of output from a module, and that allows us
to easily chain modules. A module that would output 2 types of data
would essentially be a fork in the pipeline process. That means that
either the next component knows to expect these two outputs as inputs or
we have to explicitly deal with the two branches of the fork. But then
we can not longer write pipelines like:

    step1 | step2 | step3

There is a simple workaround for this kind of situation: Make two
components/modules that each output either of the outputs. This fits in
the API of a modules and those can again be chained easily. Having said
that, we are thinking of ways to allow the output of multiple output
files because this workaround is not efficient at all.
