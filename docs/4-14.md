## Step 15 - Make output files/paths unique

Let us describe a way to avoid the above issue. There are other
approaches to resolve this issue, but let us for the moment look at one
that can easily be reused.

``` groovy
// Step - 15
process process_step15 {
    publishDir "output/${config.id}"
    input:
        tuple val(id), file(input), val(config)
    output:
        tuple val("${id}"), file("output.txt"), val("${config}")
    script:
        """
        a=`cat $input`
        let result="\$a + ${config.term}"
        echo "\$result" > output.txt
        """
}
workflow step15 {
    Channel.fromPath( params.input ) \
        | map{ el ->
            [
              el.baseName,
              el,
              [
                "id": el.baseName,
                "operator" : "-",
                "term" : 10
              ]
            ] } \
        | process_step15 \
        | view{ [ it[0], it[1] ] }
}
```

This results in the following:

``` sh
> nextflow -q run . -entry step15 --input "data/input?.txt"
WARN: DSL 2 IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE UNDER DEVELOPMENT -- SYNTAX MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE RELEASE
[input3, <...>/work/a1/0947168c069ee6f4e1e7a850f268ea/output.txt]
[input1, <...>/work/d2/41f7e0ec2fb3f8e4204aca6bf952ab/output.txt]
[input2, <...>/work/f5/845a17a4e548c531b7c63a06e50304/output.txt]
```

With the following result:

``` sh
> cat output/input?/output.txt
11
12
13
```

In other words, since (in this case 3) parallel branches each write to
the same output location we have to make sure that we add something
unique for every of the parallel branches. Another approach is to tweak
the name of the output file in the `process`, but for the moment it is
still fixed and defined in the `process` itself. Let us take a look at
that aspect next.
