## Step 12 - Map/reduce in NextFlow

Let's implement a simple map/reduce schema with what we developed above.
Until now, we basically covered the mapping stage: starting from 3
independent number, execute a function on each *branch* individually.
Now, we want to calculate the sum at the end (reduce phase).

We do this by adding a `process` to the example in Step 10

``` groovy
// Step - 12
process process_step12 {
  input:
    tuple val(id), val(input), val(term)
  output:
    tuple val("${id}"), val(output), val("${term}")
  exec:
    output = input.sum()
}
workflow step12 {
  Channel.from( [ 1, 2, 3 ] ) \
    | map{ el -> [ el.toString(), el, 10 ] } \
    | process_step10a \
    | toList \
    | map{
      [
        "sum",
        it.collect{ id, value, config -> value },
        [ : ]
      ] } \
    | process_step12 \
    | view{ [ it[0], it[1] ] }
}
```

Running this yields:

``` sh
> nextflow -q run . -entry step12
WARN: DSL 2 IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE UNDER DEVELOPMENT -- SYNTAX MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE RELEASE
[sum, 36]
```

A few remarks are in order here:

1.  We use the `toList` operator on the output of `process_step10a`.
    This can be regarded as merging the 3 parallel branches into one
    branch. The result has the signature `Channel[List[Triplet]]`. This
    `toList` operator only *outputs* something on the output `Channel`
    when all incoming branches have finished and the *merge* can
    effectively be performed.
2.  It's important to note that what is passed through the pipe is still
    a `Channel`, only the number of *branches*, *nodes*, or whatever you
    want to call it differs.
3.  The long `map{ [ "sum", ... }` line may seem complex at first, but
    it's really not. We take in `List[Triplet]` and convert this to
    `Triplet`. The first element of the triplet is just an identifier
    (`sum`). The last is the configuration map, but we don't need
    configuration for the sum. As the second element we want to obtain
    `List[Int]`, where the values are the 2nd element from the original
    triplets. The Groovy function `collect` on an array is like `map` in
    many other languages.

The marble diagram can be depicted conceptually as follows, where we
note that in effect it's triplets rather than numbers that are contained
in the marbles:

![](figures/step12.png){width="50%"}

Please note that though we define the *pipeline* sequentially, the 3
numbers are first handled in parallel and only combined when calling
`toList`. Stated differently, parallelism comes for free when defining
workflows like this.
