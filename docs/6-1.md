## Reasons for an explicit *flow*

In DiFlow, we do not allow multiple input `Channel`s, but rather make
the flow of data explicit by means of the available `Channel` operators.
There are a few reasons for this:

1.  It's easier to use a consistent API for modules, so that we don't
    need to *know* how to call a module
2.  This makes for cleaner view on what a pipeline does by looking at
    the pipeline code
3.  The asynchronous nature of the computations may cause
    inconsistencies

Let us illustrate the latter point a bit more in detail. In what follows
we define the *same* process in two scenarios: once where we allow two
input process and once where we define the flow explicitly using the
`join` operator.

First the process that takes two inputs:

    Such that


    ```sh
    > nextflow -q run . -entry join_process -with-dag figures/join_process.png
    WARN: DSL 2 IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE UNDER DEVELOPMENT -- SYNTAX MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE RELEASE
    [[1, 11/d], [2, 21/c], [3, 31/b], [4, 41/a]]

The second implementation *seems* to do the same:

    Such that


    ```sh
    > nextflow -q run . -entry join_stream -with-dag figures/join_stream.png
    WARN: DSL 2 IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE UNDER DEVELOPMENT -- SYNTAX MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE RELEASE
    [[1, 11a], [2, 21b], [3, 31c], [4, 41d]]
