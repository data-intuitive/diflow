## Resources

When you run or export with the `DockerTarget`, resources are
automatically added to the running container and stored under
`/resources`. In case of the `NativeTarget`, this is not the case and
since `NextFlowTarget` uses the `NativeTarget` it's the same there. That
does not mean that resources specified in `functionality.yaml` are not
available in these cases, we only have to point to them where
appropriate.

The following snippet (from `ct/singler`) illustrates this:

``` r
par = list(
  input = "input.h5ad",
  output = "output.h5ad",
  reference = "HPCA",
  outputField = "cellType",
  pruningMADS = 3,
  outputFieldPruned = "celltype-pruned",
  reportOutputPath = "report.md"
)
par$resources_dir <- resources_dir
```

In other words, `resources_dir` is automatically created by `viash` in
all current 3 environments. This means that we can point to the
`report.Rmd` file present in the resources like so:

``` r
rmarkdown::render(paste0(par$resources_dir, "/", "report.Rmd"), output_file = par$reportOutputPath)
```
