## Step 4 - How `map` is synchronous

An illustrative test is one where we do not use a `process` for the
execution, but rather just `map` but such that one of the inputs *takes
longer* to process, i.e.:

``` groovy
// Step - 4
def waitAndReturn(it) { sleep(2000); return it }
workflow step4 {
  Channel.from( [ 1, 2, 3 ] ) \
    | map{ (it == 2) ? waitAndReturn(it) : it } \
    | map{ it + 1 } \
    | view{ it }
}
```

Running it:

``` sh
> nextflow -q run . -entry step4
WARN: DSL 2 IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE UNDER DEVELOPMENT -- SYNTAX MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE RELEASE
2
3
4
```

The result may be somewhat unexpected, the order is retained even though
there's a 2 second delay between the first entry and the rest. The
`sleep` in other words blocks all the parallel execution branches.

This is a clear indication of why it's better to use a `process` to
execute computations. On the other hand, as long as we *stay* inside the
`map` and don't run a `process`, the order is retained. This opens up
possibilities that we will exploit in what follows.
