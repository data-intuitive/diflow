## Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)

If you're new to Functional Reactive Programming (FRP), here are a few
pointers to posts and a video that introduce the concepts:

-   An excellent [Medium
    post](https://itnext.io/demystifying-functional-reactive-programming-67767dbe520b)
    from Timo Stöttner
-   The
    [introduction](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754)
    to Reactive Programming you've been missing from André Staltz.
-   A very insightful
    [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdol03pcvMA) by
    Staltz where he introduces FRP from first principles (with live
    coding).

In what follows, we will refer to *streams* in line with those authors
but if you're used to working with [Rx](http://reactivex.io/) you would
call this an observable.
