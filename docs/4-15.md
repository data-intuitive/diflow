## Step 16 - Where to put `params`?

We want the output filename to be configurable. That means that we
either use the `params` map for this (and take care it is available in
modules that are `include`d) or we pass it to the `process` as part of
the input. Let us explore both scenarios.

But first, we need to understand a bit better where the contents of
`params` comes from. We already covered a few examples where we specify
a `params` key on the CLI. There is another way as well, via
`nextflow.config`. In it, we can add a scope `params` and add the
configuration there.

Let us reconsider the previous example (`step15`) but this time add a
`nextflow.config` file like this (please update the `<...>` part
according to your situation):

params.input = "\$PWD/data/input?.txt"

Let us illustrate the effect by means of two examples:

``` sh
> nextflow -q run . -entry step15
WARN: DSL 2 IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE UNDER DEVELOPMENT -- SYNTAX MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE RELEASE
[input3, <...>/work/d3/3b7016780d0a10bc43a4a1e303edbc/output.txt]
[input1, <...>/work/e8/52a69a6234d9008041151f0ddaea06/output.txt]
[input2, <...>/work/c9/ff527e7934c309ec34ee4fabdf0654/output.txt]
```

``` sh
> nextflow -q run . -entry step15 --input data/input1.txt
WARN: DSL 2 IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE UNDER DEVELOPMENT -- SYNTAX MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE RELEASE
[input1, <...>/work/4a/9479b71506cc1ca0c536ad587498af/output.txt]
```

In other words, `params` can be defined in `nextflow.config` but if it
appears on the CLI then the latter gets priority. Please be reminded
that `params` is a map, the following is equivalent:

    params {
        input = "/.../diflow/data/*.txt"
    }
