## The NoPipeline approach

For developing the pipeline, we set out with a few goals in mind:

-   Build modules where each modules deals with a specific
    (computational) task
-   Make sure those modules can be reused
-   Make sure the module functionality can be tested and validated
-   Make sure modules have a consistent API, so that
    a.  calling a module is straightforward
    b.  including a module in a pipeline is transparent and seamless

Please note that nothing in these requirements has to do with running a
pipeline itself. Rather, we consider this a bottom-up system whereby we
first focus on a solid foundation before we actually start to tie things
together.

That's why we call this the NoPipeline approach, similar to NoSQL where
'No' does not stand for *not*, but rather 'Not Only'. The idea is to
focus on the pipeline aspect *after* the steps are properly defined and
tested.
