## Introduction

For a step-by-step introduction to NextFlow (both the original DSL as
well as DSL2), please refer to [this
repository](https://github.com/vibbits/nextflow-course) created and
maintained by the [VIB](https://vib.be/).

Another very interesting resource is [this
cheatsheet](https://github.com/danrlu/Nextflow_cheatsheet) by Daniele
Cook. It not only contains a handy cheat sheet, but also some
conventions one should know about as well as some pitfalls.
