## Step 24 - `workflow` instead of `process`

We already have quite some helper functionality that should be provided
by a DiFlow module:

-   Generating an output file name based on input
-   Parsing different types of input file references
-   Selecting the proper key from the (large) `ConfigMap` stored in the
    global `params` `Map`.
-   Generating the CLI from `nextflow.config`
-   Providing a test case for the module

There is some hidden functionality as well:

-   Making sure input and output file references are updated in the
    `ConfigMap`
-   Dealing with per-sample configuration (upcoming feature)

As it turns out, providing all this functionality in a `process` is not
the proper way to go, and is even expected not to work. Luckily we can
define `workflow`s in NextFlow's DSL2 syntax. Such a `workflow` can be
used just like a `process` in the above example as long as we take care
that the input/output signatures are aligned with what is expected.

The added benefit of using a `workflow` rather than a `process` is that
the underlying `process` can have a different signature. In practice,
this is what a DiFlow `process` looks like:

``` groovy
process cellranger_process {
  ...
  container "${params.dockerPrefix}${container}"
  publishDir "${params.output}/processed_data/${id}/", mode: 'copy', overwrite: true
  input:
    tuple val(id), path(input), val(output), val(container), val(cli)
  output:
    tuple val("${id}"), path("${output}")
  script:
    """
    export PATH="${moduleDir}:\$PATH"
    $cli
    """
}
```

As can be seen, the `ConfigMap` is not passed to the `process` but
instead the information in `params` is used to generate an `output`
filename, extract the container image and generate the CLI instruction.
Please note that `input` here points to ALL possible input file
references as per Step 23.

The `workflow` that points to this `process` is then defined as follows:

``` groovy
workflow cellranger {
  take:
    id_input_params_
  main:
    ...
    result_ =  ...
  emit:
    result_
}
```
