## Variables in `nextflow.config`

CLI arguments and options for specific components/steps in the pipeline
are configured in the respective `nextflow.config` files that are
imported in the global one. But that also means that we can not override
them from the CLI anymore. For instance, it is not possible to add an
argument in the style `--component.input.value <value>`. That means that
all options would either be fixed for the whole pipeline, or to be
configured in `nextflow.config` explicitly. The latter is possible by
means of a custom config file that overrides the other settings.

There is, however, an easier approach to this: variables in
`nextflow.config`. The functionality is explained
[here](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#config-variables)
and is used in DiFlow for allowing us to provide the (scoped) parameter
values on the CLI. For instance, this is an excerpt from an existing
component's `nextflow.config`:

``` groovy
params {
  ...
  cellranger_vdj__id = "cr"
  ...
  cellranger_vdj {
    name = "cellranger_vdj"
    container = "mapping/cellranger_vdj/cellranger_vdj:4.0.0-1"
    command = "cellranger_vdj"
    arguments {
      ...
      id {
        name = "id"
        otype = "--"
        value = "${params.cellranger_vdj__id}"
        ...
      }
      ...
```

If you look at this one parameter for the `cellranger_vdj` component,
you notice that directly under `params`, we have the key
`cellranger_vdj__id`. In other words, the component name followed by a
double underscore and then the parameter name. Since all arguments are
named here, we do not have to have to specify `-`'s or `--`'s.
