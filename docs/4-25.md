## Step 26 - The missing link

Creating and maintaining all the necessary files for a modules,
especially with the amount of (duplicate) boilerplate code in each of
them may seem like a daunting task. It is... Therefore, we developed a
tool that is able to add the boilerplate for us: `viash`.

[`viash`](To%20be%20open-sourced%20soon!) takes as input a specification
of a command/tool, how to run and test it. `viash` can then turn this
specification into runnable script, a containerized executable or a
NextFlow module.
