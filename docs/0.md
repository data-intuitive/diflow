# Introduction

[DiFlow](https://pointer)[^1] is an abstraction layer on top of
[NextFlow](https://www.nextflow.io/)'s
[DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html). DiFlow is a set
of principles and guidelines for building NextFlow pipelines that allow
the developer to declaratively define processing components and the user
to declare the pipeline logic in a clean and intuitive way.

[Viash](http://data-intuitive.com/viash_docs) is a tool that (among
other things) allows us to *use* DiFlow and make it practical, without
the burden of maintaining boilerplate or *glue* code.
