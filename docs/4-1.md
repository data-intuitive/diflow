## Step 2 - Operate on a stream in parallel

NextFlow (and streams in general) are supposed to be a good fit for
parallel execution. Let's see how this can be done:

``` groovy
// Step - 2
workflow step2 {
  Channel.from( [ 1, 2, 3 ] ) \
    | map{ it + 1 } \
    | view{ it }
}
```

Running it can be done using:

``` sh
> nextflow -q run . -entry step2
