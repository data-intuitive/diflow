## Step 1 - Operate on a *stream*

Let us illustrate the stream-like nature of a NXF `Channel` using a very
simple example: computing $1+1$.

``` groovy
// Step - 1
workflow step1 {
  Channel.from(1) \
    | map{ it + 1 } \
    | view{ it }
}
```

This chunk is directly taken from `main.nf`, running it can be done as
follows:

``` sh
> nextflow -q run . -entry step1
