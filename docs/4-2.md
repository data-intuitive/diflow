## Step 3 - Operate on a stream using a `process`

In the previous example, we ran 3 parallel executions each time applying
the same simple function: adding one. Let us simulate now a more
real-life example where parallel executions will not take the same
amount of time. We do this by defining a `process` and `workflow` that
uses this process. The rest is similar to our example before.

``` groovy
// Step - 3
process add {
  input:
    val(input)
  output:
    val(output)
  exec:
    output = input + 1
}
workflow step3 {
  Channel.from( [ 1, 2, 3 ] ) \
    | add \
    | view{ it }
}
```

Running it is again the same.

``` sh
> nextflow -q run . -entry step3
WARN: DSL 2 IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE UNDER DEVELOPMENT -- SYNTAX MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE RELEASE
2
4
3
```

The result will be a permutation of 2,3 and 4. Try it multiple times to
verify for yourself that the order is not guaranteed to be the same.
Even though the execution times will not be that much different! In
other words, a `Channel` does not guarantee the order, and that's a good
thing.
