## Step 17 - Add the output file to `params`

In this case, we would add a `output = ...` key to `nextflow.config` or
provide `--output ...` on the CLI. This is done in the following
example:

``` groovy
// Step - 17
process process_step17 {
    publishDir "output"
    input:
        tuple val(id), file(input), val(config)
    output:
        tuple val("${id}"), file(params.output), val("${config}")
    script:
        """
        a=`cat $input`
        let result="\$a + ${config.term}"
        echo "\$result" > ${params.output}
        """
}
workflow step17 {
    Channel.fromPath( params.input ) \
        | map{ el ->
          [
            el.baseName.toString(),
            el,
            [
              "id": el.baseName,
              "operator" : "-",
              "term" : 10
            ]
          ] } \
        | process_step17 \
        | view{ [ it[0], it[1] ] }
}
```

The code that is run:

``` sh
> nextflow -q run . -entry step17 --input data/input.txt --output output.txt
WARN: DSL 2 IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE UNDER DEVELOPMENT -- SYNTAX MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE RELEASE
[input, <...>/work/b1/7f1b50fa5f6e9fdb83bc656e8946e7/output.txt]
```

The result is:

``` sh
> cat output/output.txt
11
```

We note that the `params.output` occurs in the `output:` triplet as well
as in the script code itself. That's quite important, otherwise NextFlow
will complain the output file can not be found.

This approach does what it is supposed to do: make the output filename
configurable. There are a few drawbacks however:

1.  We would have to configure the filename for *every* process
    individually. While this can be done (`params.<process>.output` for
    instance), it requires additional bookkeeping on the side of the
    pipeline developer.
2.  It does not help much because the output filename for every parallel
    branch again has the same name. In other words, we still have to
    have the `publishDir`

In all fairness, these issues only arise when you want to *publish* the
output data because in the other case every process *lives* in its own
(unique) `work` directory.
