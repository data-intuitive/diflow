## Step 21 - Is the *triplet* really necessary?

A `process` can take multiple input `Channel`s. But then why are
struggling with triplets above? Why do we make our life harder than it
could be? Let us illustrate this with a little example. We define a
process that takes two input `Channel`s, one containing integers and the
other with strings. We simply concatenate both in the process
definition:

``` groovy
// Step - 21
process process_step21 {
    input:
        val(in1)
        val(in2)
    output:
        val(out)
    exec:
        out = in1 + in2
}
workflow step21 {
    ch1_ = Channel.from( [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] )
    ch2_ = Channel.from( ["a", "b", "c", "d" ] )
    process_step21(ch1_, ch2_) | toSortedList | view
}
```

If we run this, we get the following result:

``` sh
> nextflow -q run . -entry step21 -with-docker
WARN: DSL 2 IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE UNDER DEVELOPMENT -- SYNTAX MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE RELEASE
[1a, 2b, 3c, 4d]
```

This seems fine, it is probably what was expected to happen. If we
slightly change the workflow and add a `process` step we defined earlier
(`add`):

``` groovy
// Step - 21a
workflow step21a {
    ch1_ = Channel.from( [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] ) | add
    ch2_ = Channel.from( ["a", "b", "c", "d" ] )
    process_step21(ch1_, ch2_) | toSortedList | view
}
```

Running this two times should reveal the caveat we want to point out;

``` sh
> nextflow -q run . -entry step21a -with-docker
WARN: DSL 2 IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE UNDER DEVELOPMENT -- SYNTAX MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE RELEASE
[2d, 3a, 4c, 5b]
```

``` sh
> nextflow -q run . -entry step21a -with-docker
WARN: DSL 2 IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE UNDER DEVELOPMENT -- SYNTAX MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE RELEASE
[2d, 3a, 4c, 6b]
```

The result is not deterministic. Imagine you want to combine two input
`Channel`s like this, but one of the `Channel`s requires some additional
processing first (creating an index or a qc report) then relying on the
order of operations not consistent.

In other words, we need to stick to adding an explicit `ID` and add it
with the config to the triplet.
