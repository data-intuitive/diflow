## NextFlow DSL(2)

[DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) is a crucial
development in NextFlow because it avoid having to maintain large,
monolithic pipeline definitions in one file. With DSL2, developer can
spin off functionality in separate files and `import` what is needed.

This also potentially opens up ways to build (reusable) modules that
could be used in different projects. That is exactly what a lot of
organizations need.
