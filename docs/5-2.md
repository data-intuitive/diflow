## Per-sample configuration

When running different samples in parallel, one may sometimes want to
have parameters specific to a sample. Filter threshold, for instance,
may be different from sample to sample. Implementing this in DiFlow is
not hard per se, it is more a matter of coming up with a good way to
encode this in `nextflow.config` and the `ConfigMap`.
