## Step 20 - The order of events in a stream

We touch upon a point that we have encountered but not really considered
in-depth: the order of *things* in the `Channel` or stream. We've
noticed that the order is not predictable and we've discussed that this
is to be expected. In general, the duration of a `process` step may
depend on the data or the number of resources available at the time of
running. Also, the example where we joined the different parallel
branches (Step 12 - **REF**) was independent of the order because it
just calculated the sum.

Another consequence of the undetermined order of *events* is the fact
that during a join or reduce phase (for instance with `toList`), the
resulting order is undetermined and this messes up the caching
functionality of NextFlow.

Let us give an example with a reduce process that *does* depend on the
order of *events*. We divide the first element from the *map* phase by
the second one:

``` groovy
// Step - 20a
process process_step20 {
    input:
        tuple val(id), val(input), val(term)
    output:
        tuple val("${id}"), val(output), val("${term}")
    exec:
        output = input[0] / input[1]
}
workflow step20a {
    Channel.from( [ 1, 2 ] ) \
        | map{ el -> [ el.toString(), el, 10 ] } \
        | process_step10a \
        | toList \
        | map{ [
                  "sum",
                  it.collect{ id, value, config -> value },
                  [ : ]
               ] } \
        | process_step20 \
        | view{ [ it[0], it[1] ] }
}
```

If you run this code like this, you get something like this when
launching multiple times:

``` sh
> nextflow -q run . -entry step20a -with-docker
WARN: DSL 2 IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE UNDER DEVELOPMENT -- SYNTAX MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE RELEASE
[sum, 0.9166666667]
```

``` sh
> nextflow -q run . -entry step20a -with-docker
WARN: DSL 2 IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE UNDER DEVELOPMENT -- SYNTAX MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE RELEASE
[sum, 1.0909090909]
```

As an illustration, I've added the `-with-docker` option.

Luckily, there is a variant of the `toList` channel operator that takes
into account sorting: `toSortedList`. There are other operators as well,
but we leave it as an exercise to look those up. The `workflow` code
above simply becomes:

``` groovy
// Step - 20b
workflow step20b {
    Channel.from( [ 1, 2 ] ) \
        | map{ el -> [ el.toString(), el, 10 ] } \
        | process_step10a \
        | toSortedList{ a,b -> a[0] <=> b[0] } \
        | map{ [ "sum", it.collect{ id, value, config -> value }, [ : ] ] } \
        | process_step20 \
        | view{ [ it[0], it[1] ] }
}
```

In this example, we sort (alphabetically) on the id in the triplet.
