## Default values

In the viash `functionality` spec, no option should have an empty string
as value!

[^1]: DiFlow stands for `[NextFlow] D[SL2] I[mprovement] Flow` or maybe
    also `D[ata] I[ntuitive] Flow`?

[^2]: It *is* possible in some cases however to manipulate the `Channel`
    such that a process is effectively run twice on the same data, but
    that is a more advanced topic.

[^3]: There is more in fact: NextFlow has some logic on how to deal with
    input files/directories when using Docker. It will mount the volumes
    that contain input references. If we just add an input file
    reference as a string variable to the CLI, it will not be visible
    inside the Docker container at runtime.

[^4]: See below for more information about this and how this is encoded
    in `nextflow.config`.
