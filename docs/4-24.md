## Step 25 - Custom scripts

The attentive reader may have noticed the instruction in the `script`
section in Step 24. It adds the directory of the current *module* to the
`$PATH`. This allows us to store scripts or binaries with the NextFlow
module and still be able to call those, even if NextFlow runs all
processes from their own private `work` directory.
